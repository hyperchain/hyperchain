Hyperchain is a **foundation consortium blockchain platform** that meets the needs of industrial applications. Hyperchain integrates high-performance and reliable consensus algorithm and is compatible with the open source community's smart contract development language and execution environment. 

Hyperchain provides a high-quality platform for underlying blockchain support and a convenient and reliable all-in-one solution for decentralized applications such as **digital asset clearing**, **trusted data deposit**, **de-intermediation trade** and so on that address the needs of enterprises and industry alliances.

## Key Features of Hyperchain

* Consensus on block coherence based on **RBFT(Robust Byzantine Fault Tolerance)**
* Limit the entry of blockchain node base on **certificate authority**
* Multilevel Encryption Mechanism Based on Cryptography
* Partition consensus based on **Namespace**
* Multi-language support smart contract execution engine **HyperVM**
  * Solidity
  * Java
* Blockchain data management
  * Data visualization
  * Data archive
  * Smart contract life cycle management

## Architecture

The above diagram is a high-level overview of the system architecture used by Hyperchain.

Find more detail in the [documentation](hyperchain.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## Quick Start

### Building from Source

**Create Your Clone**
Clone the repository to a directory of your `GOPATH` source path:

```bash
mkdir -p $GOPATH/src/github.com/hyperchain
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/hyperchain
git clone https://github.com/hyperchain/hyperchain
```

**Building**
Please make sure you've installed Go tool properly, if you don't have it already, please see [Instructions](https://github.com/hyperchain/hyperchain/blob/master/docs/en/prerequisites.rst).

To build Hyperchain:

```bash
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/hyperchain/hyperchain
govendor build
```

You can run `go build` as well.

### Start up Hyperchain

Since a Hyperchain cluster needs at least 4 nodes to establish a BFT system, we recommend starting up Hyperchain nodes in these modes:

- Local Mode - Local 4 Nodes
- Distributed Mode - Distributed 4 Nodes

#### Local Mode - Local 4 Nodes

We've provided a script named `local.sh` which starts all Hyperchain nodes locally.

```bash
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/hyperchain/hyperchain/scripts
./local.sh
```

You'll see these information if all Hyperchain nodes start up properly.

```bash
$./local.sh
...
...
start up node 1 ... done
start up node 2 ... done
start up node 3 ... done
start up node 4 ... done
```

#### Distributed Mode - Distribute 4 Nodes

**Enable Password Less**
Since `server.sh` script prompts for a password when executing ssh operations, we recommend generating SSH keys on the deploy node and distribute the public key to each Hyperchain node.

1 . Generate the SSH keys, and leave the passphrase empty:

```bash
ssh-keygen

Generating public/private key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/hyperchain/.ssh/id_rsa):
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
Enter same passphrase again:
Your identification has been saved in /home/hyperchain/.ssh/id_rsa.
Your public key has been saved in /home/hyperchain/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
```

2 . Copy the key to each Hyperchain node, replacing `{username}` with the user name you created.

```bash
ssh-copy-id {username}@node1
ssh-copy-id {username}@node2
ssh-copy-id {username}@node3
ssh-copy-id {username}@node4
```

**Distribute Hyperchain**
We've provided a script named `server.sh` which distributes Hyperchain to all nodes and starts up them separately.

1 . Put servers' IP addresses into a file named serverlist.txt which under hyperchain/scripts directory.

For instance:

```bash
    cat $GOPATH/src/github.com/hyperchain/hyperchain/scripts/serverlist.txt
    172.16.1.101
    172.16.1.102
    172.16.1.103
    172.16.1.104
```

2 . Start up Hyperchain with server.sh script.

```bash
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/hyperchain/hyperchain/scripts
./server.sh
```

You'll see these information if all Hyperchain nodes start up properly.

```bash
$./server.sh
...
...
start up node 1 ... done
start up node 2 ... done
start up node 3 ... done
start up node 4 ... done
```

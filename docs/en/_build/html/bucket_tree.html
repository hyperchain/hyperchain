<h2>Overview<a class="headerlink" href="#overview" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In hyperchain, the ledger data can be divided into two parts：</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>blockchain data</p></li>
<li><p>account data</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The blockchain data includes: block, transaction, receipt and other
data. This part is what we call the blockchain in the traditional sense.
All blocks are chained sequentially from back to front in this chain,
with each block pointing to its parent block.</p>
<p>Block contains a number of transactions, the consensus module will be
responsible for the deciding order of the received transactions and
packaged into a block for distribution. After receiving a block, the
block chain node executes the transaction in sequence on the basis of
the original state, and reads/writes status data of the relevant
account during this period. When the execution ends, all account data
are written and changed atomically. The execution of each transaction
means that the blockchain has undergone a state transition.</p>
<p>The state of the blockchain refers to a collection of all the account
states on the blockchain, called <strong>world state</strong>. As support smart
contracts, like Ethereum, hyperchain abandoned the Bitcoin UTXO model
and used an account model to organize the data, so this part of the data
is called account data.</p>
<p>Therefore, hyperchain’s ledger can be broadly divided into the above two
parts, the structure diagram is as follows.</p>
<div class="figure align-default">
<img alt="" src="../../images/ledger_arch.jpeg" />
</div>
<p>In this article we will not start the discussion of the structure of the
ledger, but to discuss a tree structure used to <em>quickly calculate the
world state hash</em>.</p>
<p>In hyperchain, after each block executed, each node needs to compare
whether the results of the execution is consistent in the third phase of
BFT. In other words, the account data needs to be consistent in each
node. Therefore, the hyperchain uses a bucket tree structure to hash the
account data. The nodes only need to compare the <em>tree hash values</em> to
determine the consistency of the account data.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>Bucket tree does not organize and maintain the account data
directly, but only calculates the hash.</p>
</div>
<p>Bucket tree has the following characteristics：</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Provides a mechanism to quickly calculate the hash of account data;</p></li>
<li><p>Provides a mechanism for ledger rollback;</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The theory of bucket tree in hyperchain is the earliest learned from the
<em>fabric project</em>, a series of reconstruction and optimization, making
the final performance in line with production needs. In the following,
the structure of this tree, the core operations, and the final
performance are described in detail.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="structural-analysis">
<h2>Structural analysis<a class="headerlink" href="#structural-analysis" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Bucket tree is actually a combination of two different data structures,
the two data structures are：</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>merkle tree</p></li>
<li><p>hash table</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore, before introducing the structure of bucket tree, we first
briefly introduce these two data structures。</p>
<div class="section" id="merkle-tree">
<h3>merkle tree<a class="headerlink" href="#merkle-tree" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The Merkle tree was introduced many years ago by computer scientist
Ralph Merkle and named with his own name. This data structure is used in
bitcoin networks for verification of data correctness.</p>
<p>In bitcoin networks, the merkle tree is used to summarize all
transactions in a block and to generate a digital fingerprint of the
entire transaction set. In addition, due to the existence of the merkle
tree, it becomes possible to extend a “light node” for simple payment
verification in the case of a Bitcoin chain.</p>
<p><strong>Features</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Merkle tree is a kind of tree, most of them are binary tree, also can
be multi-tree. It has all the characteristics of tree structure;</p></li>
<li><p>Merkle tree leaf node value is the content of the data entry, or the
data entry hash value;</p></li>
<li><p>The value of a non-leaf node is calculated by Hash according to the
information of its child node;</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Principle</strong></p>
<p>In bitcoin networks, the merkle tree is built from the bottom up. In the
example below, we first hash the four data entry of ENTRY1-ENTRY4 and
then store the hash value to the corresponding leaf node. These nodes
are Hash0-0, Hash0-1, Hash1-0, Hash1-1</p>
<div class="figure align-default">
<img alt="" src="../../images/merkle.jpeg" />
</div>
<p>Combine two adjacent node’s hash into a single string, and then
calculate the hash of this string.</p>
<p>The result is the parent node’s hash value of these two nodes.</p>
<p>If the number of tree nodes in this layer is a single number, then this
case directly performs hashing on the last remaining tree node, and the
hash of its parent node is the hash of its hash value (for the singular
There are different ways to deal with leaf nodes, and you can copy the
last leaf node to get even number of leaf nodes). Loop repeat the
calculation process, get the last node as the root node, the hash of the
root node is the hash of the entire tree.</p>
<p>If the two trees have the same root hash, the contents of the two trees
must be the same.</p>
<p>The advantage of using the merkle tree is that when the content of a
node changes, it only needs to recalculate the hash of <em>all the tree
nodes in the path from the node to the root node</em> to obtain a hash that
can represent the status of the whole tree value.</p>
<p>It is also because of this feature of the merkle tree that the bucket
tree avoids many unnecessary computational overheads and has the ability
to quickly compute the world state hash.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="hash-table">
<h3>Hash table<a class="headerlink" href="#hash-table" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Hash table, also known as hash table, is a very familiar data structure,
is based on the key (key) and direct access to the memory storage
location. In other words, it speeds up lookup by calculating a function
on the key that maps the data of the desired query to a location in the
table to access the record. This mapping function is called a hash
function, the record array is called a hash table.</p>
<div class="figure align-default">
<img alt="" src="../../images/hashtable.jpeg" />
</div>
<p>The description about the hash is not repeat here. In the bucket tree,
use the hash table to maintain the original data。</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="id1">
<h3>bucket tree<a class="headerlink" href="#id1" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<div class="figure align-default">
<img alt="" src="../../images/bucket_tree_arch.jpeg" />
</div>
<p>Bucket tree consists of two parts: the bottom hash table and the upper
merkel tree. Bucket tree is actually a merkle tree built on the hash
table.</p>
<p>A hash table consists of a series of buckets, each of which contains a
number of entries that have been hashed into the bucket, all of which
are arranged in sequence. Each bucket has a hash value to represent the
state of the entire hash bucket, which is hashed according to the
contents of all the data entries in the bucket.</p>
<p>Except the underlying hashtable, the upper level is a series of merkle
tree nodes. A merkle tree node corresponds to n hash buckets or merkle
tree nodes in the lower level. This n is also called the degree of
aggregation of the merkle tree. The merkle tree node maintains the hash
values of the n child nodes, and the hash value of the merkle tree node
is calculated according to the hash values of the n child nodes.</p>
<p>So continuous iteration, the ultimate tree node is the root node of the
entire tree, the node’s hash value represents the hash of the entire
tree.</p>
<p>The purpose of this design is：</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Using the characteristics of the merkle tree, the computational cost
of re-hashing is minimized every time the tree state changes;</p></li>
<li><p>The use of hash table for the maintenance of the underlying data,
making the data entries evenly distributed;</p></li>
</ul>
<p>For example, in the figure above, a new data entry <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">entry5</span></code> is
inserted, and the data entry is hashed to a bucket at POS 2. The bucket,
as well as all the nodes from the bucket to the root node are dirty
nodes marked in pink. Recalculation only with these dirty nodes can
gives you a new hash value to represent the new tree state.</p>
<p>Because the bucket tree is a fixed-size tree (that is, the underlying
hash table can not be changed after the tree has been initialized).
Using hash table to distribute data entries evenly can avoid data
aggregation occurs.</p>
<p>In addition, bucket tree has two important tunable parameters：</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>capacity</p></li>
<li><p>aggreation</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The former indicates the <strong>capacity of the hash table</strong>. The larger
capacity, more number of data entries that the entire tree can
accommodate. Under the condition of the same degree of aggregation, the
larger capacity, the higher tree height, and more number of tree nodes
in the path from the leaf node to the root node, the number of hash
calculation increases.</p>
<p>The latter represents <strong>the number of child nodes corresponding to a
parent node</strong>. The larger aggreation, the faster the tree converges.
Under the premise of the same hash table capacity, the tree height is
lower, the number of tree nodes in the path from the leaf node to the
root node is less, and the hash calculation times are reduced. However,
the size of each Merkle tree node is larger, which increases the
database IO overhead.</p>

<p>In addition, bucket tree in order to</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>increase the efficiency of reading</p></li>
<li><p>to prevent write loss</p></li>
</ol>
<p>uses two caches for cache hash bucket and merkle node data.</p>
<p>These two cache are achieved by LRUCache, each update will be
synchronized to update the contents of the cache. So, the during next
hash calculation, bucket tree can hit hot data from the cache and try to
avoid the disk read.</p>
<p>As for the prevention of write loss, since <strong>validation</strong> and <strong>commit</strong>
are two separate asynchronous processes in hyperchain, validation of
block 101 may be performed immediately based on the state the validation
process of block 100 proceeds. At this moment, the modification of the
ledger in the execution of the block 100 has not yet been submitted to
the database, so in order to “prevent write loss”, the contents need to
hit from the cache.</p>
<p>If at this moment there is a situation where the capacity of the cache
is <strong>too small</strong> and the content that which not submitted is driven out.
The result of the validation of the block 101 is inconsistent with other
nodes (usually the primary node). When this happen, this node will enter
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">recovery</span></code> procedure and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">rbft</span></code> will promise the corecctness.</p>
<p>The bucket cache is used to store the hash bucket data, each hash bucket
is a cache data item. The problem is that a hash bucket itself consists
of a number of data entries, with the running time increasing, the size
of a hash bucket will be larger and larger, resulting in increasing
memory usage.</p>
<p>The merkle node cache is used to store all merkle node data except for
the highest layer. The number of merkle nodes is fixed, and the size of
each node is also capped. Therefore, merkle node cache does not have a
problem that content occupancy is increased.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="prepare">
<h3>Prepare<a class="headerlink" href="#prepare" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>During the preparation phase, the bucket tree receives the modified set
passed in by the user and constructs a dirty set of hash buckets using
the contents of the modified set. Note that in the returned hash bucket,
the internal data items are arranged in ascending lexicographical order.</p>

<h3>Process<a class="headerlink" href="#process" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Process is the hash recalculation phase, can be divided into two parts
(1) dirty hash bucket re-calculation (2) dirty merkle node hash
re-calculation.</p>
<div class="figure align-default">
<img alt="" src="../../images/bucket_process.jpeg" />
</div>
<p><strong>Dirty hash bucket re-calculation</strong></p>
<p>As shown in the figure above, two new entry data items entry5 and entry6
are inserted in the bucket tree. The hash address obtained by entry5 is
Pos2, and the hash address obtained by entry6 is Pos5.</p>
<p>There is a merge operation in Pos2 to insert the new data and merge with
historical data with the fixed sorting algorithm to reorder, and
ultimately get a new hash bucket, contains all new and old data in
order.</p>
<p>The hash value of each hash bucket is <em>a result of hashing the data in
the whole bucket</em>.</p>
<p>As shown in the figure, Pos2 and Pos5 are two dirty hash buckets. After
the calculation is completed, the corresponding child hash value is set
in the parent node.</p>
<p><strong>Dirty merkle node re-calculation</strong></p>
<p>When the hash bucket calculation is completed, the hash calculation of
the merkle node can be performed. In this step, only the dirty merkle
nodes are hash calculated.</p>
<p>Note that the hash calculation of the merkle node is done
hierarchically.</p>
<p>Each merkle node maintains the hash value of its child node, and if the
child node hash value of the lower layer changes, the latest hash value
is placed in the parent node in the previous calculation. For no change
child node, bucket tree can directly use the history value.</p>
<p>The hash value of each merkle node is <em>a result of hashing all its child
node hashes</em>.</p>

<div class="section" id="commit">
<h3>Commit<a class="headerlink" href="#commit" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>After the calculation is completed, the latest hash bucket data and
merkle node data needs to be persisted.</p>
<p>In addition, all the hash bucket data, merkle node data will be stored
in the cache as hot data, both to improve data search efficiency, but
also to avoid data write loss.</p>

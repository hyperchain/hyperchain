Hyperchain Roadmap
==================

Currently, hyperchain is available in the open source community with 1.4
stable version, will continue to introduce new features in the future.

Welcome to join the community of Hyperchain to participate in our
development!

First community version
-----------------------

This is the first community version of Hyperchain that includes the
complete components of the consortium blockchain platform:

1. Consensus engine based on RBFT algorithm;
2. Compatible with Ethereum smart contract virtual machine;
3. Data partition, isolate the business data physically ;
4. Rich event subscription interface, capture blockchain platform events
   in real-time;
5. Multi-level encryption mechanism, including asymmetric encryption,
   symmetric encryption, admittance mechanism based on digital
   certificate;
6. Available level of performance to meet the needs of most business
   scenarios;

Better smart contract
---------------------

This version is planned to be released in February 2018.

The main feature is to support the smart contract development in the
Java language, reducing the difficulty for blockchain application
development.

In addition, there will have a easy-to-use hyperchain docker images for
one-click cluster deployments.

Controllable data capacity
--------------------------

Currently, the existing blockchain data is accumulated, so the storage
capacity of blockchain data will be a big problem.

We plan to release a version in April 2018 to support archiving of
blockchain data and archiving of smart contract data.

Autonomous
----------

The existing consortium blockchain admittance mechanism has the
following problems:

1. There is a single point of failure;
2. The entire blockchain network is easy to be controlled by a single
   node;
3. Low degree of automation;

Therefore, we propose to release a version to support decentralized
autonomous admittance mechanism in July 2018 that will enable automated
member management, identity switching, version upgrades and more.

Protect your pricacy
--------------------

Currently in the same partition, blockchain data is shared by all nodes,
and there is no user privacy at all. In September 2018, we will release
a version that support two advanced cryptographic features to protect
user privacy.

The two cryptographic techniques are (1) zero knowledge proof (2) ring
signature technique.

Run fast
--------

Currently hyperchain's performance can meet the needs of most business
scenarios, but for particularly high-frequency and complex scenarios
still do nothing. As a result, we will make major adjustments to the
existing architecture to transform hyperchain with microservices and
cloud-based architectures so as to improve performance.

This version is scheduled to be released in December 2018.

What is your favourite
----------------------

In June 2019, we will release a version that supports multiple consensus
algorithms to support dynamic consensus engine switching.

Besides we plan to come up with a new consensus algorithm that will
support larger node sizes in consortium blockchain.

Quick Start
===========

If you haven't completed your :doc:`prerequisites` Checklist, do that
first. This Quick Start tells you how to build Hyperchain from source
code, and how to start up a Hyperchain cluster.

Building from Source
--------------------

Create Your Clone
`````````````````
Clone the repository to a directory of your
``GOPATH`` source path:

.. code:: bash

    mkdir -p $GOPATH/src/github.com/hyperchain
    cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/hyperchain
    git clone https://github.com/hyperchain/hyperchain

Building
````````
Please make sure you've installed Go tool properly, if you
don't have it already, please see :doc:`prerequisites`

To build Hyperchain:

.. code:: bash

    cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/hyperchain/hyperchain
    govendor build

You can run ``go build`` as well.

Start up Hyperchain
-------------------

Since a Hyperchain cluster needs at least 4 nodes to establish 
a BFT system, we recommend starting up Hyperchain nodes in these modes:
- Local Mode - Local 4 Nodes
- Distributed Mode - Distributed 4 Nodes

Local Mode - Local 4 Nodes
``````````````````````````

We've provided a script named ``local.sh`` which starts all Hyperchain
nodes locally.

.. code:: bash

    cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/hyperchain/hyperchain/scripts
    ./local.sh

You'll see these information if all Hyperchain nodes start up properly.

.. code:: bash

    $./local.sh
    ...
    ...
    start up node 1 ... done
    start up node 2 ... done
    start up node 3 ... done
    start up node 4 ... done

Distributed Mode - Distribute 4 Nodes
`````````````````````````````````````

Enable Password Less
''''''''''''''''''''
Since ``server.sh`` script prompts for a
password when executing ssh operations, we recommend generating SSH keys
on the deploy node and distribute the public key to each Hyperchain
node.

1. Generate the SSH keys, and leave the passphrase empty:

.. code:: bash

    ssh-keygen

    Generating public/private key pair.
    Enter file in which to save the key (/home/hyperchain/.ssh/id_rsa):
    Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
    Enter same passphrase again:
    Your identification has been saved in /home/hyperchain/.ssh/id_rsa.
    Your public key has been saved in /home/hyperchain/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.

2. Copy the key to each Hyperchain node, replacing ``{username}`` with
the user name you created.

.. code:: bash

    ssh-copy-id {username}@node1
    ssh-copy-id {username}@node2
    ssh-copy-id {username}@node3
    ssh-copy-id {username}@node4

Distribute Hyperchain
'''''''''''''''''''''
We've provided a script named ``server.sh``
which distributes Hyperchain to all nodes and starts up them separately.

1. Put servers' IP addresses into a file named serverlist.txt which 
under hyperchain/scripts directory.

For instance: 

.. code:: bash

    cat $GOPATH/src/github.com/hyperchain/hyperchain/scripts/serverlist.txt
    172.16.1.101
    172.16.1.102
    172.16.1.103
    172.16.1.104

2. Start up Hyperchain with server.sh script.

.. code:: bash

    cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/hyperchain/hyperchain/scripts
    ./server.sh

You'll see these information if all Hyperchain nodes start up properly.

.. code:: bash

    $./server.sh
    ...
    ...
    start up node 1 ... done
    start up node 2 ... done
    start up node 3 ... done
    start up node 4 ... done

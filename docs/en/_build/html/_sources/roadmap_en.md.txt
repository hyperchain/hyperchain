# Hyperchain Roadmap

## Hyperchain 1.X

### 2018-01
***IPC Shell***
Provide IPC Shell, IPC Shell provide Hyperchain network debugging function;

### 2018-02
***JVM-based smart contract execution engine***
For the simplicity of blockchain smart contract writing and support for complex smart contracts, Hyperchain will provide a high-performance JVM-based smart contract execution engine that allows users to write smart contracts in Java.

### 2018-03
***External messaging subscription system***
In order to enable enterprise users to better monitor the operation of Hyperchain platform, Hyperchain platform will provide a unified external event subscription interface. Enterprise users can capture and monitor the operation status of Hyperchain in time according to their own regulatory requirements.

### 2018-04
***Data archive mechanism***
As the running time of the blockchain system increases, the storage of blocks and data storage capacity in the system also increases sharply. The data archiving function allows archiving and storing the historical data so as to solve the problem of insufficient storage space in a single blockchain node.

## Hyperchain 2.X

Hyperchain version 2.X will further improve system performance, including scalability of single-point systems, storage performance of single-point systems, scalability of the number of federation nodes, and further refinement of blockchain privacy protection mechanisms.

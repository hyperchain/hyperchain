Smart Contract
==============

1. Introduction
---------------
.. Note::

    A smart contract is a piece of computer program deployed on the
    blockchain that automatically executes the terms. Smart contract can
    automatically execute predefined protocols based on outside input
    and complete the transfer of relevant status within the blockchain.

In the wide sense, smart contracts also include smart contract
programming languages, compilers, virtual machines, events, state
machines, fault tolerance mechanisms, and more. The most import
components of smart contract is the smart contract programming language
and its execution engine.

Smart contract virtual machines are generally sandboxed for security
reasons, and the entire execution environment is completely
isolated.Smart contracts executed inside virtual machines are not
allowed to access to system resources such as network, file system,
process threads, and so on.

Different smart contracts own different levels of security and richness
of expression. The HyperVM, which is developed independently by the
Hyperchain team, is a general-purpose intelligent contract engine
designed to allow access by many different smart contract engines.
Currently, HyperEVM is compatible with Ethereum's Solidity language and
HyperJVM, a Java-enabled smart contract execution engine.

2. Smart contract execution engine HyperVM
------------------------------------------

HyperVM developed by Hyperchain is a pluggable smart contract engine
generic framework that allows different smart contract execution engine
embed.

As shown in the following figure is the schematic diagram of HyperVM
architecture, HyperVM architecture provides smart contract compiler,
interpreter, executor and state management components and other related
major components. Among them, Compiler provides smart contract
compilation related functions, Interpreter and Executor provide smart
contract interpretation and execution related functions, and State
components help contract to operate blockchain ledger. Guard module
provides smart contract security-related mechanisms.

2.1 HyperEVM
~~~~~~~~~~~~

To maximize the open source community's research and accumulation in
smart contract technologies, enhance the reusability and compatibility
of smart contracts. HyperEVM implementation uses a fully compliant
Ethereum smart contract specification using Solidity as the smart
contract development language and adopt the optimized Ethereum virtual
machine EVM as the default backend execution engine.

The following figure shows the HyperEVM smart contract execution flow:

HyperEVM executes a transaction, it returns an execution result. The
system stores it in a variable called a transaction receipt, and the
platform client can query the transaction result according to the
current transaction hash.

This process runs as follows:

1. HyperEVM received the upper transmission of the transaction, and do
   preliminary verification;
2. Determine the type of transaction, if it is the disposition of the
   contract, go to step 3, otherwise go to step 4;
3. HyperEVM create a new contract account to store the contract address
   and the compiled code;
4. HyperEVM verify transaction parameters and signature information, and
   call its execution engine to execute the corresponding smart contract
   byte code;
5. After the instruction is executed, HyperVM will determine if it is
   down normaly, skip Step 2 if not, otherwise go to Step 6;
6. Determine whether the shutdown state of HyperVM is normal, and if it
   is normal, stop execution; otherwise, go to Step 7;
7. Undo operation, the state should also rollback.

The instruction set execution module is the core of HyperEVM execution
component.The execution of the instruction module has two
implementations, namely bytecode-based execution and more complex and
efficient Just-in-time compilation.

Bytecode implementation is relatively simple, HyperEVM virtual machine
have an instruction execution unit. The instruction execution unit will
always try to execute the instruction set. When the designated time is
not completed, the virtual machine will interrupt the calculation logic
and return a timeout error message to prevent the execution of malicious
code in the smart contract.

JIT execution is relatively more complex, instant compilation also known
as timely compilation, real-time compilation, is a form of dynamic
compilation is a way to improve the efficiency of the program. In
general, there are two ways to run a program: static compilation and
dynamic transliteration. Statically compiled programs are all translated
into machine code before execution, while literal translation is
performed while translation is performed. The real-time compiler mixes
both, compiling the source code sentence by sentence, but caches
translated code to reduce performance penalties. Compare to the static
compiled code, compiled code on the fly can handle delayed binding and
enhance security. JIT execution model mainly includes the following
steps:

1. All the information related to the smart contract is encapsulated in
   the contract object, and then find out whether the contract object
   stored and compiled by the hash of the code.There are four common
   status of the contract object, namely: unknown, compiled, ready to
   execute through JIT, error.
2. If the contract status is ready for execution through the JIT,
   HyperEVM selects the JIT executor to execute the contract. During
   execution, the virtual machine will further compile the compiled
   smart contract into a machine code and optimize the push and jump
   instructions.
3. If the contract status is unknown, HyperEVM first needs to check if
   the virtual machine is forcing the JIT to execute, and if so, it will
   be compiled sequentially and executed by the JTI instruction.
   Otherwise, open a separate thread to compile, the current program is
   still compiled by ordinary bytecode. Next time the virtual machine
   encounters the same encoded contract again during execution, the
   virtual machine directly selects the optimized contract. As a result
   of the optimization of the instruction set of such a contract, the
   efficiency of the execution and deployment of the contract can be
   greatly improved.

3. Usage of Smart contract
--------------------------

3.1 Smart Contract Based on the Solidity
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Write a contract
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Solidity-based smart contract is similar to a JavaScript program and
consists of a series of variables and related functions. Below is a
smart contract that simulates simple accumulator functionality. We use
this as an example to briefly introduce the basic components of a
Solidity smart contract.

.. code:: js

    contract Accumulator{    
        uint32 sum = 0;   
        function increment(){ 
            sum = sum + 1;     
        }    

        function getSum() returns(uint32){
            return sum;    
        }   

        function add(uint32 num1,uint32 num2) {
            sum = sum+num1+num2;     
        }
    }

Accumulator contract description:

-  Solidity-based smart contracts begin with the keyword ``contract``,
   similar to the keyword ``class`` in Java and other languages;
-  The contract can have variables and functions inside, the sum is a
   simple variable uint32 type, Solidity smart contract also supports
   map and other complex collection types;
-  The contract allows the definition of the implementation of the
   function ``function`` keyword definition;

(https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/develop/) for detailed specification
of smart contracts based on the Solidity language.

Compile the contract
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Hyperchain's smart contracts can be compiled either with the official
Solidity compiler or using the smart contract JSON-RPC interface
provided by Hyperchain (this scenario requires installing the Solidity
compiler ``sloc`` on the host where Hyperchain installed).

The command which call Hyperchain to compile the solidity smart contract
as follows:

.. code:: js

    curl -X POST --data 
    '{
        "jsonrpc":"2.0", 
        "namespace":"global", 
        "method":"contract_compileContract", 
        "params":["contract_code"],
        "id":1
    }'

The contract compilation call returned as follows:

.. code:: js

    {
      "jsonrpc": "2.0",
      "namespace":"global",
      "id": 1,
      "code": 0,
      "message": "SUCCESS",
      "result": {
        "abi": [
          "[{\"constant\":false,\"inputs\":[{\"name\":\"num1\",\"type\":\"uint32\"},{\"name\":\"num2\",\"type\":\"uint32\"}],\"name\":\"add\",\"outputs\":[],\"payable\":false,\"type\":\"function\"},{\"constant\":false,\"inputs\":[],\"name\":\"getSum\",\"outputs\":[{\"name\":\"\",\"type\":\"uint32\"}],\"payable\":false,\"type\":\"function\"},{\"constant\":false,\"inputs\":[],\"name\":\"increment\",\"outputs\":[],\"payable\":false,\"type\":\"function\"}]"
        ],
        "bin": [
          "0x60606040526000805463ffffffff1916815560ae908190601e90396000f3606060405260e060020a60003504633ad14af381146030578063569c5f6d14605e578063d09de08a146084575b6002565b346002576000805460e060020a60243560043563ffffffff8416010181020463ffffffff199091161790555b005b3460025760005463ffffffff166040805163ffffffff9092168252519081900360200190f35b34600257605c6000805460e060020a63ffffffff821660010181020463ffffffff1990911617905556"
        ],
        "types": [
          "Accumulator"
        ]
      }
    }

The content corresponding to the field bin is the bytecode
representation of the contract, and the bin will be used for subsequent
deployment.

Deploy the contract
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Hyperchain deploy solidity contract command is as follows:

.. code:: js

    curl localhost:8081 --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0", "namespace":"global",  "method":"contract_deployContract", "params":[{
    "from":"0x17d806c92fa941b4b7a8ffffc58fa2f297a3bffc ",
    "nonce":5373500328656597,
    "payload":"0x60606040526000805463ffffffff1916815560ae908190601e90396000f3606060405260e060020a60003504633ad14af381146030578063569c5f6d14605e578063d09de08a146084575b6002565b346002576000805460e060020a60243560043563ffffffff8416010181020463ffffffff199091161790555b005b3460025760005463ffffffff166040805163ffffffff9092168252519081900360200190f35b34600257605c6000805460e060020a63ffffffff821660010181020463ffffffff1990911617905556",
    "signature":"0x388ad7cb71b1281eb5a0746fa8fe6fda006bd28571cbe69947ff0115ff8f3cd00bdf2f45748e0068e49803428999280dc69a71cc95a2305bd2abf813574bcea900",
    "timestamp":1487771157166000000
    }],"id":"1"}'

Deploy contract execution is returned as follows, where the result field
is the address of the contract in the blockchain, and the contract
address needs to be specified for subsequent execution call to the
contract.

.. code:: js


    {
        "jsonrpc": "2.0",
        "namespace":"global",
        "id": 1,
        "code": 0,
        "message": "SUCCESS",
        "result": "0x406f89cb205e136411fd7f5befbf8383bbfdec5f6e8bcfe50b16dcff037d1d8a"
    }

Call contract
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Hyperchain invocation command is as follows, where ``payload`` is
the encoding result of the function in the invocation contract and its
parameter value, and ``to`` is the address of the invoked contract.

.. code:: js

    curl localhost:8081 --data 

    '{
        "jsonrpc":"2.0", 
        "namespace":"global", 
        "method": "contract_invokeContract", 
        "params":[{
                "from":"0x17d806c92fa941b4b7a8ffffc58fa2f297a3bffc",
                "nonce":5019420501875693,
                "payload":"0x3ad14af300000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000010000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000002",
                "signature":"0xde467ec4c0bd9033bdc3b6faa43a8d3c5dcf393ed9f34ec1c1310b0859a0ecba15c5be4480a9ad2aaaea8416324cb54e769856775dd5407f9fd64f0467331c9301",
                "simulate":false,
                "timestamp":1487773188814000000,
                "to":"0x313bbf563991dc4c1be9d98a058a26108adfcf81"
                }],
        "id":"1"
    }'

The contract call will immediately return the hash value of the
transaction to the client, and later query the execution result of the
specific transaction according to the hash value of the transaction.

.. code:: js

    {
        "jsonrpc":"2.0",
        "namespace":"global",
        "id":1,
        "code":0,
        "message":"SUCCESS",
        "result":"0xd7a07fbc8ea43ace5c36c14b375ea1e1bc216366b09a6a3b08ed098995c08fde"
    }

The other contract operation methods and specifications of methods
parameters are detailed in: [Hyperchain API Documentation] ()
